Write a smart contract to conduct a fair election among candidates. We will be using bytes32 variables as candidate names.

The smart contract should have:

An array of uint to bytes32 mapping to store the votes received by each candidate.

A constructor that takes the names of candidates as input and stores them.

A function to vote for a candidate that takes the candidate's name as input.

A function that returns the votes received by a candidate and takes candidate name as input.

Note: Before processing voting or counting of total votes,
make sure that a candidate is valid 
[Hint: Write a function to check candidate validity, and use require() or a modifier to make sure the candidate is valid before executing the function.]
